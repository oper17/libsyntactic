VeVa(Vedvarha's) Syntactic (2005) (Neural Network Library)
code named: 
Oper17 Team.
This is the first major version of Syntactic. THough there was an earlier version, it was an experimental one limited in many ways.
This version is more flexible and user-friendly.
It uses enhanced algorithms and coding technology.
Hope it is found useful.
